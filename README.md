🧠 What drives me

I’m currently pursuing a BSc in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence and actively looking for a year-long industrial placement or internship to apply and deepen my data engineering skills. My focus: turning data into actionable insights, building robust data pipelines, and mastering the tools that power modern analytics.

🔧 What I bring to the table

Proficiency in Python (Pandas, NumPy) and SQL, plus a solid foundation in web development (HTML/CSS/JS) and version control (Git/GitHub).

Experienced with data cleaning, transformation, visualisation, and exploratory analysis — thanks to hands-on projects analysing the UK job market for data roles.

Passionate about cloud and big-data technologies (AWS, Azure, Spark, Airflow) and how they shape the future of data engineering.

A reliable collaborator with strong problem-solving skills, ready to learn fast, adapt, and contribute meaningfully in team settings.

🏗 My GitHub space

Here you’ll find:

Real-world data-engineering and analytics projects, including market-trend analyses and skill-salary correlations.

Code that’s clean, documented, and designed for re-use or extension.

Visualisations and insights that tell stories — not just numbers.

Take a look around! If you’d like to collaborate, share ideas, or explore placement opportunities — I’m all ears.
